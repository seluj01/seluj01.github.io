# Personal notes about engineering

## Objective
* Find quickly often-used concepts/formulas/algorithms/code
* Explain these concepts in my own words
* Help me remember these concepts while building these notes

## Guidelines
* Efficiency
    - Only subjects that are approachable and interesting
    - Not chasing perfection, as long as there is improvement...
* Storing knowledge, not information
    - No thorough proofs but concise and intuitive explanations
* No fancy language and correct synthax, writing to myself as simple notes
